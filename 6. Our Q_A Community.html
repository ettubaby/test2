            <h4>How to Use the Q&amp;A</h4>

<p><br>Along the way you will have many questions. Please don't be shy and ask as many as you would like and I will try and respond as soon as possible. This course should be a two way conversation between the instructor and the student. So I look forward to hearing your questions. I will also be uploading explainer videos with some of the most popular questions that I get. <br><br></p><p><strong>****Please note: It is better to post your questions to the Slack group so you can receive a faster reply since myself as well as the community will answer based on who sees it first! We are a community of very helpful individuals trying to learn coding together so don't be shy.  The Q&amp;A section is good for video specific questions on the Lecture Player (see below)</strong><strong>*****</strong></p><p><br>This course has a Q&amp;A just for us, where you can ask myself questions about the course. You can quickly view answers that I have posted, ask your own question, or read and respond to comments your fellow students have made.</p>

<p><br><strong>Posting a Question</strong> <br>There are two ways to search for existing questions and post new ones:</p>









<p><strong>1. Ask a Question in the Lecture Player</strong></p>









<ul><li>If a question comes to mind while you’re viewing or reading a course lecture, you can access the Q&amp;A, by clicking on Browse Q&amp;A at the bottom of the lecture player. This will bring up the Q&amp;A on the right hand side. </li></ul>









<ul><li>Next, you will see the Search for a question section at the top right. Type your question in that section, and if another student has asked this question before, it will appear below. Question and answers containing the same words will also appear. </li></ul>









<ul><li>If no one has asked your question in the past, then click on the green Ask a new question.</li></ul>









<p><strong>2. Ask a Question on the Course Dashboard</strong></p>











<p>The other way to access the Q&amp;A is to do so while you’re on the course dashboard. On the course dashboard, you can see Q&amp;A as the third tab on the page. If you click on it you will see the questions board.</p>











<p>The Q&amp;A here works the same way as it does in the lecture player. You can search for a certain question or words by entering it in the search for question box.</p>











<p>With the dashboard view, you can also sort by relevancy and sort by popularity filters.</p>
